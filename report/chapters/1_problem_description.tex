\chapter{Problem Description}

The fundamental goal of this project is to inform and improve business decisions for the bike-sharing platform Lyft. By conducting analysis on historical data, we aim at identifying patterns and trends that unfold demand-driving factors and thereby enhance allocation. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of these behavioural patterns, we generate costumer, time and spatial based clusters and provide hourly demand forecasting.
