    "3. Data description and preperation\n",
    "To conduct the previously mentioned analysis, we utilized the following data sets: sf_2019.csv, weather_hourly_sf.csv, and Sf_2019_full.csv. In the following section, we will provide an overview of the data and explain the steps we took to prepare it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\section{Ride Data}\n",
    "The data for the bike rides is located in the sf_2019.csv file and includes 2,506,982 trips that were taken in San Francisco in 2019. The file provides us with information about the start and end time, start and end station, as well as the user type, which can be either a subscriber or a customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "images/descriptive_rides\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we examined the data for missing or incomplete values, and any duplicate entries. Thankfully, we did not find any duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve our analysis, we then added additional features to the dataset such as start hour, start weekday, start month, and trip duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then combined the geo-data (from Ch. 3.2) with the trips data set. Thereby, we drop all collumns expect for the station_id aswell as the actual geo data. We then refined the dataset to only include data from stations located in San Francisco. We also removed any trips with negative trip durations. To remove outliers, we eliminated the top 0.5\\% of trip durations, which were all trips that lasted longer than two hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\section{Weather Data}\n",
    "The file weather_hourly_sf.csv gives us information about the weather in San Francisco in 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "images/descriptive_weather\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis of the weather data, we checked for any missing values or duplicate entries, similar to the process used for the rides data set. We did not find any missing values, but we did find 79 duplicate rows across all columns of the dataframe and 371 duplicate entries in the date_time column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided not to drop any columns easily. Instead, we counted how often temperature changes occurred across the entire dataset. Temperature changes on an hourly basis at odds of roughly 2:1. The duplicated rows in the dataframe can therefore be a result of duplicated entries in the date_time column co-occurring with a natural steady temperature trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then determined the expected number of entries in the dataframe (the dataframe starts at 2019-01-31) to check whether the number of entries does not exceed the number of expected entries considerably. The actual and expected numbers were found to match, except for 4 entries. Additionally, Temperature values tend not to change within the course of an hour in non-duplicates as well, therefore we could not declare the duplicates as redundant data. As a result, we kept the entries but adjusted the date_time column. Dropping duplic\tates and interpolating new values was not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with the duplicate entries, we created a function that takes duplicated date_time entries as input and shifts these timestamps forward until no date_time duplicates remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\section{Geo Data}\n",
    "The SF_2019_full.csv is a combination of many files from the Lyft website. It contains information about the station id, geo data and other information. We dropped data that we didnt need from the set like  \"rental_access_method\" and \"bike_share_for_all_trip\". We also dropped NaNs and added the same features like we did in chapter 3.1.\n",

    "4: Description\n",
    "4.1 Temporal Demand Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "We aggregated the variable time on the different hierarchy levels month, weekday and hour. The monthly demand shows no clear trend, because of low temperature variaten between the seasons in San Francisco. On Weekends there is less demand indicating that bike usage is mainly for trips. This assumption is supported by the hourly demand patterns. Peaks are at the morning hours around 8am and at around 5pm. Between 1am und 5am demand is at a minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "images/rides_plotted\n",
    "\n",
    "To investiagte the weather dataset we plotted the variable temparature over the hierarchy levels month, weekday and hour. Temperatures get to a maximum in July and August and drop to a minimum in February. Therefore the demand pattern follow no clear temperature pattern, since there are maxima in demand in March and April. \n",
    "\n",
    "images/weather_plotted\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heat Map displays weekly trips through the combination of weekday and hour dimensions. It highlights that weekdays are busier than weekends during the peak commuting hours of 8 am and 5 pm, possibly indicating the presence of people traveling to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "images/rides_heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Geographical Demand Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heatmap plots geopgraphical locations of stations by latitude and longitude. Stations that are used frequently are yellow to red and stations used sparsely are coloured purple. The main activity takes place at daytime in downtown San Francisco, more specifically in Valencia Street and Market Street. Other frequent stations are located around King Street and the docks. At nighttime stations are less frequently used and turn purple or disappear from the map. Interactive use of the heatmap is not possible via pdf but with the notebooks in the repository that is linked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the monthly interactive Heatmap shows that trips taken at the beginning of the year are more centralised and trips taken towards the end of the year spread across a greater area, especially in the western city.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Key Performance Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "To monitor the fleet operations from a management perspective we introduced the following KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we investigate the ratio of trips taken by subscribers and non-subcribers to differentiated between these pricing models. The average share of trips taken by subscribers across the whole dataset is around 79%. Towards the end of the year the ratio drops significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question how often it is necessary to relocate a bike in a given time interval we introduced the Relocation KPI. Therefore we compared end stations to subsequent start stations to determine if relocations occured. There is a peak of relocations at end of July that could be potentially due to maintenance efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third KPI shows the distinct bikes in use per hour. On average there are around 200-300 bikes in use per hour. Furthermore the weekday patterns are identifiable. The peak at end of July could be related to the peak of the relocation KPI. To monitor the distribution we compared trips taken to distinct bikes. Values close to zero indicate a bad distribution of the bikes whereas values near to one mean that the number of bikes used and trips taken is almost identical and thus indicate a good distribution of the bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our fourth KPI, we chose the revenue per hour. On average Lyft has a revenue of about 900 USD per hour in San Francisco. The range of revenue per hour lies between a minimum of 3.49 USD and a maximum of 5760 USD. \n",
    "\n",
    "5: Clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "Trip Clustering \n",
    "Our trip clustering was based on the features month, weekday, hour, is_weekend, user_type and trip duration. Method wise we used the k-means clustering approach since it guarantess convergence and is \n",
    "scales to large datasets. On the downside we had to choose k the number of cluster manually. Therefore we did a grid search to identify the elbow. After comparing k=3 and k=4 clusters we preferred to set k=3, because additional cluster mainly just split the user_type 'customer'\n",
    "in two different day time clusters. The 3 resulting clusters all were sufficient in size and easily distinguishable leading to a high content of information per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster No. 0 \"Early Rides to work\": Customers are characterized by a short trip duration compared to Cluster 1. They are taking trips in the typical\n",
    "work hour pattern described in the analysis section, but only in the morning hours. The cluster size of Cluster 0 and Cluster 2 are evenly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster No. 1 \"Weekend rides\": Weekend rides are distinguishable by their weekday distribution, taking trips exclusively on weekends. Users on weekends\n",
    "are taking less short rides and more longer trips, assuming that these are related to leisure activities. In terms of customer type the distribution shows no large deviation to the\n",
    "customer trip ratio of around 79% across the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster No. 2 \"Late rides from work\": The most distinctive feature is the time of day as of cluster one, but including only evening hours. Their subscriber share resembles\n",
    "the one of cluster 1. related to typical working hours, with only weekdays being included in the cluster aswell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the clusters created by K-Means algorithm, we presumed that the monthly feature is of less distinctive character, what was confirmed in\n",
    "the predictive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "images/rides_cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Clustering\n",
    "The following features were used for K-Means Weather Data Clustering: precipitation, maximal temperature, months, weekday and hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 \"Nightriders\": Cluster 0 has a greater share of rides with precipitation and a lower average temperature. Rides are distributed\n",
    "around early morning hours and late evening hours where temperatures are obviously lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1 \"Workers\": This cluster reconstructs the work and weekday patterns of the trip cluserting. Temperature wise the cluster is evenly distributed.\n",
    " \n",
    "Cluster 2 \"Midday rides\": Cluster 2 has the highest average temperature and rare precipitation. Trips are taken around midday more often compared\n",
    "to the other clusters. There is no weekday variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "images/weather_cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Station Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters are computed based on location and usage. Therefore they show the stations that are heavily frequented, less frequented\n",
    "and an in between cluster. As described in the Geographical Data Analysis there are stations that can be charcaterized by being used \n",
    "less frequent and being distributed across a big area. These are grouped together in the cluster called \"Low Performer\". The \"High Performer\" - cluster are exactly the stations along the market street together with the eastern stations close to the docks. These are the stations that are freuqented the most. Stations in the \"Medium Performer\" -Cluster  are located mainly in downton aswell but spread are greater area than the \"High Performer\" - Cluster the area along the Valencia street. These stations are also popular, but not as popular as the \"Highperformers\" \n",
